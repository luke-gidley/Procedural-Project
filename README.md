# Procedural-Project
Coursework 2 for Fundamentals of Programming. 

EasyGraphics.ccp/h are not written by me, they are from Sheffield Hallam University.

This project piece is a small "follow me" game.
The game works by sending out an avatar which creates a path that must be memorised by the player.
The player must then follow the path after the avatar has finished drawing it. 
The game goes on infinitely until the player fails.

This piece of work was marked at 95.6 but due to covid was never moderated fully.
